After perl installation,
You can run 'perl' at everywhere to run perl srcipt file.

Run:
I provide an input directory: 'httpd-fs' at 
  the same path location to 'makefsdata' 
I run as : perl makefsdata (this is a perl script file)

Notice: JPG was not correct converted by 'makefsdata' scripter,
  Only I add a 0x0d BYTE into the data_logo_jpg[], and then everything 
  is ok.
